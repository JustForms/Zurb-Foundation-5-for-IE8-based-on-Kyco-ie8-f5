==============================================

Zurb Foundation 5 for IE8 - Just trying to get https://github.com/kyco/ie8-f5 parts to work... based on what Cornelius did. I'm a noob, I'm missing something... hoping to get some help from the community. Thank you in advance for any help the community may provide.
